# IDSpatialStats

This github repository provides source code for the `IDSpatialStats` R package, which is designed to help epidemiologists assess the scale of spatial and temporal dependence in epidemic case occurrence data. Currently, the package includes a function which simulates infectious disease spread as a spatial branching process, along with two novel spatial statistics that estimate: 1) The mean of the spatial transmission kernelm which is a measure of fine-scale spatial dependence between two cases, that is interpreted as the mean distance between sequential cases in a transmission chain, and 2) the tau-statistic, a measure of global clustering based on pathogen subtype.
